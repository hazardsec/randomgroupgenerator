# randomgroupgenerator
Excel spreadsheet for creating random groupings of students (2-10 groups of 10 or less).

Replace the numbers with student first names on the "Names" worksheet and hit "Update Groups" on the "Groups" worksheet. Will need to "Enable Content" to use the macro run by the "Update Groups" button.
